Hi, I'm Parshant Deswal.
I am interested to make people's life more simple and easy through technology.
As I am a student of Computer Science I have always been attracted towards different tools used to build apps, manage data and a lot of other things as well,
There is too much potential in this field for tech developers and researchers, we can do far more than what we have already achieved with the compueters.
I am looking forward to contribute in the giant tech industry in anyway possible.
